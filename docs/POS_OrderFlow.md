# POS Order Flow

> **Purpose**  
> States & transitions from Order creation to Handover/Delivery/Settlement.

---

## States

- `DRAFT` â€” optional parked cart
- `UNPAID` â€” created order (ticket optional), awaiting cashier or dispatch
- `PARTIALLY_PAID` â€” some payment received, balance > 0
- `PAID` â€” fully settled (receipts print)
- `CANCELLED` â€” closed before handover/dispatch (no stock movement)
- `VOIDED` â€” reversal after stock movement/payment (restock/refund)

---

## Key Transitions

- **Create Order** (no print or with ticket): `DRAFT â†’ UNPAID`
- **In-store, pay now**: `UNPAID â†’ PAID` (inventory deducts on PAID)
- **In-store, utang/partial**: `UNPAID â†’ UNPAID|PARTIALLY_PAID` + `releaseWithBalance=true` (inventory deducts at release)
- **Delivery**:
  - Prepare: `UNPAID â†’ FULFILLMENT.NEW â†’ PICKING â†’ PACKING`
  - **DISPATCHED** (inventory deducts here)
  - `DELIVERED` (proof on paper for now)
  - End-of-day **RemitBatch** â†’ apply collected payments â†’ remaining balances stay PARTIALLY_PAID/UNPAID until cleared
- **Expiry**: UNPAID past `expiryAt` auto-`CANCELLED` (queue janitor)
- **Reprints** do not change state.

---

## Fulfillment (Ticketed or Delivery)

NEW â†’ PICKING â†’ PACKING â†’ DISPATCHED â†’ DELIVERED
â†˜ ON_HOLD â†—

- **ON_HOLD** for stock/weight mismatches; resolve within fulfillment or escalate to VOID.

---

## Paper

- **Order Ticket** (optional, 57 mm): queue/handover aid.
- **Official Receipt** (57 mm): prints on PAID (or at remit for delivery COD).

---

## Auto-Cancel & Purge

- Auto-cancel `UNPAID` when `expiryAt < now` (not locked or stale lock).
- Purge `CANCELLED` older than 24h.

# POS Credit Flow (Utang Management)

## Overview

- This document defines how credit (utang) and partial payments are handled in the POS system.
  It separates three types of documents/receipts:

  1. Credit Acknowledgment Receipt â€“ proof that goods were released without full payment.

  2. Payment Acknowledgment Receipt â€“ proof of a payment made toward an outstanding balance.

  3. Statement of Account (SOA) â€“ summary of all credit + payments per customer.

## 1. Credit Acknowledgment Receipt

- Issued when goods leave the store without full payment.

- Trigger: Order is released while still UNPAID or PARTIALLY_PAID.

- Contains:

  - Order details (items, qty, price, total)

  - Customer info (name, alias, phone)

  - Total credited balance

  - Due date (if set)

  - Approver (if release-with-balance was authorized)

  ** ðŸ“„ Purpose: This is the utang slip. It documents that the store extended credit for this order. **

## 2. Payment Acknowledgment Receipt

- Issued when a customer makes a payment (partial or full).

- Trigger: A new record is added in the Payment table.

- Contains:

  - Order reference

  - Payment amount + method (Cash, GCash, etc.)

  - Running balance (after this payment)

  - Timestamp of payment

* ðŸ“„ Purpose: This is the payment slip. It provides proof of each installment or settlement.

## 3. Statement of Account (SOA)

- Generated per customer, not per order.

- Contains:

  - List of all credited orders

  - List of all payments made

  - Total outstanding balance

- Typically used for monthly reconciliation or follow-up.

* ðŸ“„ Purpose: This is the long-term account record. Itâ€™s not printed by default after a transaction, but can be requested.

## Flow Summary

1. Order released on credit â†’ Print Credit Acknowledgment Receipt.

2. Customer makes payment â†’ Print Payment Acknowledgment Receipt.

3. Store wants summary per customer â†’ Generate Statement of Account.

## Notes

1.  Reprinting:

- Credit Ack can be reprinted any time from the order page.

- Payment Ack can be reprinted from the payment record.

2.  Balances:

- Always computed from Order.totalBeforeDiscount - SUM(Payments.amount).

- Credit flag (Order.isOnCredit) ensures order is tracked.

3. Future:

- SOA module can export to PDF/Excel for external reporting.
