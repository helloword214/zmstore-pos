POS Code Snippets - key logic or hard decisions

Update the UI of this component to match our elegant light POS dashboard design (rounded-2xl cards, soft shadows, subtle borders, slate/indigo palette, clean typography). Keep all logic, data, and handlers untouched â€” UI/UX only. Apply consistent style like the Cashier Queue / Order Pad / Dashboard we already have.
