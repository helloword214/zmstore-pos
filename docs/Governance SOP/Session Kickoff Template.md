## 9. Command Contract (optional but recommended)

(Para iwas ambiguity sa `GO`)

- Mode:
  - [ ] Manual
  - [ ] Combined (busy mode)

- Manual commands:
  - `GO-PATCH` = edits only
  - `EXECUTE: <command>` = run specific command only
  - `CHECK` = checks only
  - `COMMIT: <message>` = commit only
  - `PR` = create PR only
  - `MERGE-SQUASH` = squash merge only

- Combined commands:
  - `FLOW SAVE: <message>` = patch + check + commit
  - `FLOW PR: <message>` = flow save + push + PR create
  - `FLOW SHIP: <message>` = flow PR + squash merge + cleanup

- Safety overrides:
  - `FORCE-COMMIT` (only if check fails and user still wants commit)
