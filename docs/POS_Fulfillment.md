## ON_HOLD ‚Äî Rules & Resolution

> üîé Definition: `ON_HOLD` is an **operations issue after payment** (picking/packing stage), e.g., stock shortage discovered, wrong item pulled, or weighing problem.

### What NOT to do

- ‚ùå Do **not** send the order back to cashier.
- ‚ùå Do **not** create a new order automatically.

### Correct Actions

1. **Try to resolve within fulfillment** (no cashier involved):

   - Pull from alternate location/bin.
   - Open a new sack (convert packing ‚Üí retail stock).
   - Substitute with the **same SKU** from another batch/lot.
   - Re‚Äëweigh and repack.

2. **If resolved** ‚Üí move the order **back to PICKING/PACKING** and continue:

   - `ON_HOLD ‚Üí PICKING` (if you need to repick)
   - `ON_HOLD ‚Üí PACKING` (if only re-bagging/weight fix)
   - Then `READY_FOR_PICKUP ‚Üí HANDED_OVER`.

3. **If NOT resolvable** (no stock, customer refuses alternatives):
   - Manager performs **VOID** (post‚Äëpayment):
     - Requires **reason + PIN**.
     - System creates **reversal entries** (refund) and **restores stock**.
     - Order ends as `VOIDED`.
   - If customer still wants different items ‚Üí **start a new order** manually.

### Audit

- Log `onHoldReason`, attempts taken, who resolved (pickedBy/packedBy), timestamps.
- If VOID: record refund method and reference.
