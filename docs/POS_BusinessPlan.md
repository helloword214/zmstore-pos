# POS Business Plan

> üìå Purpose:  
> This document describes the **big picture business logic** of the POS system.  
> It explains _why_ the system behaves this way, not just _how to code it_.
>
> üõ† When to update:
>
> - When a **new rule** is added (e.g., discount policy changes).
> - When a **milestone** is completed (add summary under "Milestones Applied").
> - When a **business decision** is reversed (cross out old rule, add new one with date).
>
> ‚úÖ Readers:
>
> - Self-taught devs (like us now).
> - Future devs joining the project.
> - Non-technical stakeholders who want to understand the workflow.

## Vision

Fast-food style **Kiosk ‚Üí Cashier ‚Üí Fulfillment** flow adapted to retail (rice, feeds, pet supplies, LPG).

## Core Principles

- **Kiosk**: Customer builds order, prints Order Slip (NO discounts).
- **Cashier**: Verifies order, applies discounts, collects payment.
- **Receipt**: Only issued when order is `PAID`.
- **Inventory**: Deducted only when `PAID`.
- **Fulfillment**: Picking/Packing starts after payment.

## Milestones Applied

### Milestone K1 ‚Äî Kiosk UI (Tablet-First)

**Scope (UI only, no discounts/payment yet)**

- Tablet-first kiosk for item selection and cart building.
- Category chips + search, product grid, sticky cart.
- Qty rules: retail-allowed ‚Üí step 0.25; pack-only ‚Üí step 1.
- ‚ÄúPrint Order Slip‚Äù posts snapshot to `/orders.new`.

**Out of scope (moved to later milestones)**

- Discounts, promos, customer data, barcode scan, cashier lock/queue.

**Why (business)**

- Faster iteration: visualize flow before wiring deeper backend.
- Reduces kiosk training time (big buttons, clear totals).
- Aligns with ‚ÄúSlip first, cashier later‚Äù principle.

**Acceptance (K1 v1)**

- I can filter by category/search and add items.
- I can change qty per rules and see subtotal update.
- I can print an Order Slip from the cart.

**Spec**

- See `docs/POS_KioskUI.md` for layout, behaviors, and accessibility.

### Milestone 1 ‚Äî Order Slip

- Slip shows **totals before discounts**.
- Discounts are not applied at kiosk.
- Expiry: 24h by default.
- Reprint allowed (`Reprint #n` footer).

### Milestone 2 ‚Äî Cashier Queue & Scan

- Cashier sees all `UNPAID` orders in queue.
- Orders lock when cashier opens (to prevent double handling).
- Cashier can apply discounts (senior, PWD, promo).
- Manager PIN required for manual/override discounts.

### Milestone 3 ‚Äî Payment & Receipt

- Payment methods: Cash, GCash, Card.
- Split payments supported.
- Change always returned in cash.
- Official Receipt printed only when `PAID`.

### Milestone 4 ‚Äî Fulfillment

- Fulfillment states: `NEW ‚Üí PICKING ‚Üí PACKING ‚Üí READY_FOR_PICKUP ‚Üí HANDED_OVER`.
- Pick Ticket prints after `PAID`.
- Open Sack allowed during packing (convert sack ‚Üí retail stock).
- Abandoned orders marked `UNCLAIMED` after timeout.
